# Improve Reading Experience and Optimize UX

## Summary
This PR implements comprehensive improvements to the reading experience, optimizes loading states, expands quiz functionality to 10 questions, and enhances the overall user experience based on user feedback.

## Reading Experience Improvements

### Fixed Word Hyphenation Issues 
- **Problem**: Words were breaking incorrectly (F unções, Neuroe-tológica, Dopam-inérgico)
- **Solution**: Added `hyphens: none` in CSS and inline styles
- **Impact**: Clean, uninterrupted reading experience

### Fixed Line-Height Control
- **Problem**: Spacing control wasn't working properly
- **Solution**: Convert lineHeight value to string format
- **Impact**: Readers can now properly adjust text spacing

### Quick Access to Notes
- **Feature**: Floating Action Button (FAB) in bottom-right corner
- **Behavior**: One click scrolls to notes section and activates notes tab
- **Impact**: Seamless note-taking while reading

## Requests Page Updates
- **Response Time**: Updated from "3 a 5 dias" to "24 horas"
- **Loading State**: Smooth opacity transition instead of blocking screen
- **Impact**: Better user expectations and experience

## Loading Optimization

Removed or optimized loading states across all study components for a more fluid experience:

### Study Components
- **Checklist Tab**: Removed blocking "Carregando checklist..." screen
- **Quiz Tab**: Removed blocking "Carregando quiz..." screen  
- **Notes Tab**: Removed blocking "Carregando notas..." screen

### Gamification Components
- **Leaderboard**: Uses opacity transition (0.6) instead of loading text
- **Progress Dashboard**: Uses opacity transition instead of loading screen

**Result**: More natural, continuous user experience without jarring loading interruptions

## Quiz Expansion

### New Script: `seed-enhanced-quiz.ts`
- **Generates 10 specialized questions** per item (up from 3)
- **Question Types**:
  1. Main concept comprehension
  2. Context and practical application
  3. Critical analysis
  4. Implications and consequences
  5. Comparison and contrast
  6. Evidence and support
  7. Limitations and criticisms
  8. Synthesis and integration
  9. Contemporary relevance
  10. Advanced critical thinking

### Running the Quiz Seed
```bash
npx tsx scripts/seed-enhanced-quiz.ts
```

**Impact**: Tests deep comprehension and practical application, not just surface-level knowledge

## System Verification

### Gamification System
- ✅ Verified ranking correctly filters by `session.user.id`
- ✅ Verified progress dashboard shows only user-specific data
- ✅ Confirmed all gamification queries use proper user authentication
- **Impact**: Data isolation and privacy maintained

## Technical Improvements

### CSS Enhancements
- Added word-break rules to prevent awkward text splitting
- Improved prose paragraph styling with hyphenation controls
- Enhanced scrollbar customization

### Component Optimizations
